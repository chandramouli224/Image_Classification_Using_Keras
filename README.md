# Image_Classification_Using_Keras
This project involves the initiation and development of an image classification system using Keras. We will commence from raw JPEG image files stored on disk, specifically foregoing the use of pre-trained weights or an existing Keras Application model. The primary aim is to illustrate the entire workflow using the Kaggle Cats versus Dogs dataset, a binary classification task.
